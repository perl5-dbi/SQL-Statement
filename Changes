Changes log for Perl extension SQL::Statement

Version 1.16_02, released 1 January, 2009
------------------------------------------

* Changing join_2_tables to reduce memory usage when joining a lot of tables

* Fixed Bugs:
  * 15688   Columns aliased with double quotes are a fatal error
  * 16579   Speed optimizations
  * 30590   Bug in SQL::Statement::is_number()
  * 41875   Bug in synopsis example

Version 1.16_01, released 1 January, 2009
------------------------------------------

* With this release, I'd like to welcome Jens Rehsack as co-maintainer of
  the SQL::Statement and SQL::Parser modules.  Jens has added in some
  great improvements.
  Thanks Jens! -- Jeff 

* Adding a lot of join tests (once from Jeff, 48 from
  PostgreSQL official handbook) - no error of them will be corrected in the
  first run
  Thanks to Alexander Breibach <alexander.breibach@gmx.de> -- Jens

Version 1.15, released 2 February, 2006
----------------------------------------
* fixed placeholder bug in SQL::Statement::UPDATE
  thanks for bug report Tanktalus

Version 1.14, released 21 April, 2005
----------------------------------------
 * fixed circular dependency in tests (one mistakenly required AnyData)

Version 1.13, released 18 April, 2005
----------------------------------------
 * pod fixes

Version 1.12, released 18 April, 2005
----------------------------------------
 * added support for GROUP BY
   (several people sent suggestions for this in the past, please email me
   so I can credit you, sorry I lost the names)

 * added support for true LIMIT - if a LIMIT clause is specified and
   no ORDER BY clause is specified, the SELECT will stop searching
   when the limit is reached;  with an ORDER BY clause it will still
   search the entire table because we can only ORDER a set;  using
   LIMIT without an ORDER BY will greatly increase speed

 * added support for CREATE/DROP keyword|operator|type|function

 * optimized process_predicate to only look up scalars once

 * completely re-wrote the POD

 * fixed bug in primary key search optimization
   thanks for bug report and test scripts: Jim Lambert, <jimlambrtATmac.com>

 * fixed problem with all_cols slowing inserts
   thanks for patch and test Cosimo Streppone <cosimoATcpan.org>

 * cleaned up case of temp table column names
   thanks for bug report: Dan Wright

 * added a META.YML and extra tests

Version 1.11, released 28 March, 2005
----------------------------------------

Version 1.10, released 27 March, 2005
----------------------------------------
 * added support for CREATE TABLE AS SELECT ... and CREATE TABLE AS IMPORT()

 * added support for in-memory tables and heterogeneous operations,
   see the SQL::Parser docs

 * added many new built-in functions see SQL::Statement::Functions.pm

 * added support for user-defined functions, see SQL::Statement::Functions.pm

 * added support for column name aliases
       thanks for patch, Robert Rothenberg

 * added support for comparison to empty string (e.g. WHERE col1='')
   currently returns the same as WHERE col1 IS NULL
       thanks for patch, cpanATgoess.org

 * fixed bug in S::P::clean_sql() newline-handling,
       thanks for patch Steffen G., steffenATkonzeptloses.de

 * fixed bug in  SQL::Parser::feature()
       thanks for patch, chromatic

       thanks for suggestion, gipeol@sci.kun.nl

 * optimized portions of eval_where, process_predicate, and is_matched
   HUGE thanks Dan Wright and Dean Arnold for patches

 * HUGE thanks to Dean Arnold for all the following which should clean up
   a number of bugs in parentheses parsing and in the predicates IN and
   BETWEEN as well as speed things up considerably

	SQL::Parser changes:
	- removed recursion from get_in(), get_btwn()
	- fixed paren scan and argument separator scan in get_in()
	- optimized get_in/get_btwn code
	- made get_in/get_btwn OO methods to support
		being overridden by subclasses
	- added transform_syntax() abstract method
		to permit subclasses to add their own
		syntax extensions
	- rewrite of parens_search() to fixed predicate 
		paren processing, remove recursion, and optimize
		code
	- rewrite of non_parens_search() to fixed predicate 
		paren processing and optimize code
	- rewrite of PREDICATE to optimize code; moved
		operator regex construction to dialect
		initialization
	- change undo_string_funcs(), undo_math_funcs(),
		nongroup_numeric(), nongroup_string()
		to remove scoped recursion
	- fixed nongroup_numeric() for case insensitive
		operator match
	- fixed nongroup_string, undo_string_funcs() to
		include user defined funcs
	- fixed ROW_VALUE's scan for user defined function
		argument separator scan

     * fixed function detection regex in SQL::Parser::ROW_VALUE
 	to accomodate arbitrary spacing

     * fixed SQL::Parser::SELECT_LIST()/extract_column_list()
 	to support concat operator '||' expressions

     * added following functions to SQL::Statement::Functions:
 	- COALESCE
 	- NVL (same as COALESCE)
 	- DECODE (same as Oracle DECODE)
 	- CONCAT
 	- REPLACE/SUBSTITUTE
 
     * fixed/adapted SQL::Statement::get_row_value(), 
	SQL::Statement::SELECT(), for join'ed
 	resultsets

------------------------------------------

 * added support for delimited identifiers (inside double quotes);
   these are case sensitive and can contain spaces and other
   special chars

 * added support for two forms of escaping single quotes inside
   quoted values: 'O\'Brien' or  'O''Brien'

   comments,  e.g.  /* comment */ or -- comment

   Thanks Dean Kopesky <dean.kopesky@reuters.com>

Version 1.003, released 01 March, 2002

   case sensitive column names

     Thanks Udo Beckmann <Udo.Beckmann@trinkaus.de>

   * table name aliases in explicit joins

Version 1.002, released 5 February, 2002
----------------------------------------

 * added backwards compatiblity: both SQL::Statement and
   SQL::Parser now work in perl version 5.004 and above.

 * changed defaults for DBD::CSV so it now accepts new SQL
   without adding extra flags to scripts

 * added support for SQL comments

 * added support for temporary tables and on commit clauses in
   CREATE statements and drop behaviour flags in DROP statements
   (SQL::Parser only, not supported by SQL::Statement)

 * fixed bugs in qualified column names (e.g. tableA.*), and in
   joins using ON or WHERE

Version 1.001, released January 17,2002
---------------------------------------

Fixed bug in UPDATE that caused the new value to be a hash
rather than a scalar.

Version 1.0, released January 15, 2002
--------------------------------------

This is the first CPAN release of the pure perl version of the
module.  It was previously released in an XS version by Jochen
Wiedman who has turned over maintenance of it to me.

The new Pure Perl version of SQL::Statement supports everything
supported by the XS version and, additionally, at least partial
support for the following features that are not supported at all
by the XS version:

 * Explicit and implicit joins
 * Table name aliases
 * Set functions
 * String functions
 * String concatenation
 * Numeric expressions
 * IN predicate
 * BETWEEN predicate
 * Alphabetic comparison in WHERE clauses
 * Ordering of text that looks like a number
 * Verbose error messages for both Parsing and Execution errors
